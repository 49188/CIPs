## What is a CIP?

CIP stands for Conflux Improvement Proposal. A CIP is a design document providing information to the Conflux community, or describing a new feature for Conflux or its processes or environment. The CIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. 

We intend CIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Conflux. The CIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions. Because the CIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For Conflux implementers, CIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally implementation maintainers would list the CIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.
